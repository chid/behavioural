Lottery Loopholes and Deadly Doctors by

# Problem

![Alt text](images/united-states-personal-savings.png)

Could you come up with $2,000 within a month?

Half of Americans surveyed could not come up with this amount. (This includes lines of credit/loans etc.)

This means that half of Americans could be one accident away from dire circumstances.

// Elize likes in-class experiments.
// Why $2000
// 20% of people who earn $150,000 can't even come up with this

The main problem here is low savings rate, one of the main drivers is that we like to spend a lot of our disposable income.

// we could even include a graph of savings rate over time. Aus/US figures.

Americans spend about $60 billion -- on something that isn’t very practical, lottery tickets. In Australia we spend $7.4 billion on gambling.

Graduate Student Melissa Kearney found that many people spent a lot of money buying lottery tickets. Hundreds, even thousands a year. // improve

# Why do people play lotteries instead of saving?

DUBNER: And why do so many people play the lottery? Because it’s fun. For a dollar or two, you buy the chance to dream. To dream big. This remarkable bargain illustrates a phenomenon -- a probabilistic oddity -- that economists call “skewness.” 

KEARNEY: That’s the idea that there’s some big prize way out there that corresponds to very small odds, but there’s some potential of capturing that. [dreams, change your life]

p-effect. change your life

Behavourial finance tells us... 
Boring, long term, hyperbolic discounting.

Overweighting.

Many people play lotteries.

Low income people play the lottery at the same proporation as wealthier, people.

This is a huge cut of income.

Rewrite
Gambling
So a lot of Americans think the lottery is their only chance at winning big sums of money, why don’t we take that appetite for gambling, for a product like this, and attach it to a savings vehicle that offers some positive return?  It’s a win-win situation.

It already exists.

# Monetary Problem in South Africa


In South Africa, there was an even worse proble with savings. Millions of South Afrians did not use banks. Money was not circulating. (something needed here)

A novel solution was developed by Robert Keip working First National Bank in 2005.

It was called Prize-Linked Savings or PLS, it was caled MoMa. Million a month account. <whatever>


# The PLS !!!?!

People would invest money with First National Bank, in return for lowered or no interest payments. The bank would pool these these interest payments and pay out random prizes to account holders.

<!-- whatever. -->
This is essentially a no-lose lottery. [well not really.]

# Outcome

Great. Legal concerns unimportant.
Effects on people...!

Lots of people
DUBNER: MAMA attracted more than a million new customers to Keip’s bank. 

KEIP: About $200 million dollars, but more importantly it was over a million customers that we had brought in.

He says that 20 percent of the PLS accounts were opened by people who were previously unbanked. 

This is important why?

This was also replicanted in America, and the results.

Responding to incentives. Constrasting to convential banking accounts.

# Doctors.

Problem.
You would expect that doctors, being knowledgeable about disease spreading would haev good .

At Cedas-Sinai Medical Centre, well educated doctors have the lowest rate of hand hygiene.

It would be expected that education would be the solution.. 

They emailed, postered, even offered gift cards to doctors who washed their hands.

None of this worked.


# Solution

The administration wanted to prove to the doctors that their hands carry micro-organisms. MORE FACTS
They displayed this as a screensaver.
The worked. However to keep the 


# Outcome

Name and shame, maybe lets people think about the consequences.

# Comparing the two.
